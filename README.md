Data information:

- **ID : Identification**

- **M/F : Gender**

- **Hand : Dominant Hand**

- **Age :Age in years**

- **Educ : Education Level**  {1 < high school (HS), 2 = HS Graduate, 3 = Some College, 4 = College Graduate, 5 = Beyond College Graduate}

- **SES : Socioeconomic Status** {1 = lower, 2 = lower middle, 3 = middle, 4 = upper middle, 5 = upper}

- **MMSE : Mini Mental State Examination.**  The Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a tool that can be used to systematically and
 thoroughly assess mental status.  It is an 11-question measure that tests five areas of cognitive function:
 orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall, and language.  The maximum score is 30.  A score
 of 23 or lower is indicative of cognitive impairment.  The MMSE takes only 5-10 minutes to administer and
 is therefore practical to use repeatedly and routinely

- **CDR : Clinical Dementia Rating** {0= non-demented; 0.5 = very mild dementia; 1 = mild dementia; 2 = moderate dementia}

- **eTIV : Estimated Total Intracranial Volume**  The eTIV variable estimates intracranial brain volume.

- **nWBV : Normalize Whole Brain Volume.** Represent the percentage of the intracranial cavity occupied by brain

- **ASF : Atlas Scaling Factor** The ASF is a one-parameter scaling factor that allows for comparison of the estimated total intracranial volume (eTIV) based on differences in human anatomy
